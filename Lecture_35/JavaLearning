Question: Choose any two drawbacks of C++ (such as build complexity and pointer errors). For each, describe how Java’s approach makes learning and team programming easier. Support with simple examples.
Answer:
Pointer Errors in C++:
In C++, beginners misuse pointers (int* p; *p = 10;) → can crash programs.
Java’s approach: Java has no explicit pointers. Instead, it uses references safely
Build Complexity in C++:
In C++, you manage header files, linking, multiple compilers, etc. This confuses beginners and slows teams.
Java’s approach: One command (javac) compiles to bytecode, and java runs it.
