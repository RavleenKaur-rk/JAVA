Question: How does Java protect programmers from memory management mistakes common in C++?
Answer:
In C++, programmers manually allocate (new) and free (delete) memory, which can lead to memory leaks and dangling pointers.
In Java, memory is managed automatically by the Garbage Collector (GC), so unused objects are freed automatically.
