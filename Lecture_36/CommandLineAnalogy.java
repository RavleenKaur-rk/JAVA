// Question: Explain—using your own analogy—how command line arguments work in Java and why checking their length is important.

// Answer with Analogy:
// Think of a Java program like a delivery box 🎁.
// When you run the program, you can put some items (arguments) inside the box.
// The program opens the box and uses those items.
// If you expect 3 items but only get 1, you will miss things and the program might fail (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).
